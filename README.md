Running inference at the zoo.
- For Recruiters

* Google computer vision if you have no idea what these boxes mean.

- For other people

* Doesn't work in real time...yet. I have architecture in mind that might work.

* Seems to have trouble staying confident in ROIs that are far away from the viewing point. => Need to gather more data or try out a different algorithm or reconfigure training pipeline.

* Continue training from saved model latest checkpoint where last training finished.
